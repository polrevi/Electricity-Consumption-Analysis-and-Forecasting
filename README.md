Exploratory Data Analysis and Modeling of Household Electricity Consumption
This project includes two Jupyter notebooks:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
The first notebook explores the time series of electricity consumption. It analyzes patterns at different temporal resolutions — yearly, monthly, daily, and hourly — to better understand usage behavior over time.

Forecasting Model:
The second notebook focuses on forecasting electricity consumption. It builds predictive models using hourly and daily aggregated data to anticipate future consumption patterns.
