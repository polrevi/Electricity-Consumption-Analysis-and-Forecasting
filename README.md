# âš¡ Household Electricity Consumption â€” EDA & Forecasting

This project analyzes the electricity consumption of a household through two Jupyter notebooks:

## ðŸ“Š 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The first notebook explores the time series of electricity consumption with a focus on:

- Yearly trends
- Monthly and daily patterns
- Hourly usage behavior

The goal is to understand how consumption varies over time and identify any recurring patterns or anomalies.

## ðŸ”® 2. Forecasting Model

The second notebook develops a predictive model to forecast electricity consumption using:

- Hourly and daily aggregated data
- Time series modeling techniques

The objective is to estimate future electricity usage based on historical data.
